# Filesystem notes: Notes as files (coming soon)

This will document a proposed "files first" approach of working with Trilium. In particular it will propose a "Markdown first" approach, wherein a folder of `.md` files (with YAML frontmatter for attributes) is used to specify a note hierarchy in Trilium.

% discuss .md tree approach - obsidian, etc

% convert Note class to/from filesystem w/yaml metadata
